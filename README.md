<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Terence Dumartin</h1>
<h3 align="left">A French Data Analyst & Data Scientist!</h3>

After 9 intensive weeks learning Data Science with Python at [@LeWagon](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time), <br>
I discover a passion about **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** and I can't stop myself from learning about those topics ever since!
<br>
<br>
<h4 align="left">If you're curious about what I've learned, here is some of my new skills 👇:</h4>

- Data Analytics with SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib;

- Statistics with Scipy, Seaborn and Statsmodels;

- Machine Learning with Statsmodels and Scikit-learn

- Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, NLP) with TensorFlow and Keras

- Data Engineering (deploy code and train model on Google Cloud Platform, build an API with FastAPI, create a Docker image and deploy it on Google Run or Heroku)
